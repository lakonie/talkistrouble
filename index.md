## TALK=TROUBLE: FOUR SONGS FOR SURVIVING HEATWAVES


These simple sounds were originally recorded during extremely hot nights as an attempt to make myself tired enough to be able to fall asleep. I used a simple modular system, FM synth, sampler, sequencer and an old toy zither. Sometimes I kept the gear right next to my bed and used it till I was half asleep. Later I took the recorded material out. I played it through a loudspeaker at various places (intersection, urban wilderness, rock above a river, open pit lithium mine) and various day and night times and used a portable recorded to record how the replayed songs sound in an outdoors urban/nature setting during extreme heatwaves. The re-amped sounds were then manipulated and blended with the source files using Reaper software and bunch of plugins. That’s what you are listening to right now. 

**But why did I do all this?** As I feel it, extreme heatwaves and drought that hit Europe in the last years change the way how my city sounds. Why not, experiments of G. Lakoff from University of California, Berkeley suggest that temperature affects how we perceive relationships. In the end, the truth is that according to the law of physics weather conditions can alter the way how sound propagates through space. Both lower humidity and higher temperature affect the ability of sound to propagate by air and also the speed of sound movement. Of course, you can theoretically notice the change only for some types of noise and the acoustic setting is very important. 

**So does a city really sound different?**  Don’t trust your ears – that’s one of golden rules of mastering engineers. Social context is powerful enough to mess with our senses and just thinking about effects of extreme weather on our perception of urban sound can probably make my brain so confused that it interprets the signals coming from ears in a biased way. I might simply be so obsessed with environmental anxiety and irritated by the heatwaves that the world around seems to sound different although there might be no objective evidence of audible changes. It might as well just be the dizziness of my organism experiencing extreme heat that changes my perception of sound. 

Some people choose to avoid any non-musical references to make their music pure and open to a variety to interpretations. My idea is exactly the opposite. **Can we revoke the atmosphere of a context of creation of a sound if we are given enough information?** 

The question is: **what do you hear?**
